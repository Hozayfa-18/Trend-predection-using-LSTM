# LSTM-Based Stock Trading Prediction

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates the use of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for predicting stock trading trends. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model creation, training, and visualization of predictions.

## Features
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Handles raw financial data and formats it for time-series analysis.
- **LSTM Model Training**: Utilizes Keras/TensorFlow to construct and train the LSTM model.
- **Prediction and Visualization**:
  - Predictions on test data.
  - Future trend predictions.
  - Visualization of true and predicted values over time.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or above
- Key libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `tensorflow`

## Key Sections
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Reads and prepares the dataset for LSTM input.
   - Applies scaling and splitting into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Creation**:
   - Defines an LSTM model using the TensorFlow/Keras library.
   - Compiles and trains the model with hyperparameter tuning.

3. **Prediction and Evaluation**:
   - Evaluates the model on unseen test data.
   - Generates predictions for the test and future data points.
   - Compares predicted values with true values using visualization.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Plots true vs. predicted values for the test data.
   - Visualizes the LSTM's future predictions.

## How to Run
1. Ensure the required libraries are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow
